Reational database:
  - All the tables can use relationships to reduce retudency, so it is fast

MongoDB:
  - Here we use the JSON formate.
  - Because the data is stored in the JSON there is no need for relationships
  - This does not mean we can't make relationships, we can make relationships
  - The Aim of the mongoDb is to create database as the document.
  - This database type is called as the NoSQL
